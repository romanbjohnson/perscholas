       <h2>Hi, I'm Roman</h2>
       <h3>Welcome to my software engineer project page</h3> 

<h1>My name is Roman Johnson, Ph.D. and I am a career changer from the academic industry
 to the tech industry because it is one of the largest growing industries in the world. 
 For example, about ten years ago, technologies like artificial intelligence had a much
 smaller role in our lives. However, now technologies such as Amazon's Alexa now help 
 us with everything from our household tasks to choosing what we'd like to watch now.
</h1>


<p id="para1">  As far as my background is concerned, I grew up in Memphis, TN. Two years ago, I relocated to Boston to do a research job. I've been in Boston for the past two years and it has been a blast so far. I've really met solid community folks and built connections there as well. One of the reasons why transitioning to tech intrigues me in Boston in particular is because Boston has a huge tech industry.</p>
